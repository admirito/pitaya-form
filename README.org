* PitayaForm

*PitayaForm* defines a data representation that provides a framework
for collecting data from a user interface and converting it to the
desired data model.

The current specification is based on JSON [[[https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8259][RFC 8259]]] or other
interchangeable formats like [[https://yaml.org/][YAML]], although any data serialization
format with [[https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8259#section-3][JSON basic data types]] could be used in the same way.

The following drafts are available:

- [[./FORM.org][Pitaya Form]]
- [[./TYPES.org][Data Types]]
- [[./STYLES.org][Styles]]
- [[./VALIDATORS.org][Validators]]
- [[./REFERENCES.org][Templates and References]]
