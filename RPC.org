* Pitaya RPC Types

Implementing the following =rpc= types for the remote procedure calls
are recommended.

** =http_rest=

RPC using HTTP/HTTPS protocol. If there is a specific RPC URL for the
forntend, the =name= can be an identifier for the RPC method,
otherwise a full-url can be used as the =name=.

The following =options= may be used:

*** =method=

The HTTP method. =GET=, =POST=, etc.

*** =content_type=

Force a specific method for passing arguments,
e.g. =multipart/form-data=, =application/x-www-form-urlencoded= or
=application/json=.

** =js=

If the frontend is implemented in JavaScript it is quite easy to
implement =js= calls.

Given a dedicated =js= section in the PitayaForm containing JavaScript
functions, each function can be used just like an =RPC=.
